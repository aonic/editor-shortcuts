Brackets Editor Shortcuts
=================

A brackets extension to add various keyboard shortcuts for text editing. Currently only ```Delete Line``` is implemented.

To install, place the ```editor-shortcuts``` folder inside the ```brackets/src/extensions/user``` folder.

** NO longer needed as Sprint 15 has this built-in **

Usage
=====

Open a project in Brackets, place your cursor on a line and and select ```Delete Line``` form the ```Edit``` menu.

Alternatively, use `ctrl`+`K` on Windows, or `⌘`+`K` on Mac OS X to delete the current line.
For easy editing with one hand, `ctrl`+`shift`+`X` on Windows, or `⌘`+`shift`+`X` on Mac OS X are also enabled.
